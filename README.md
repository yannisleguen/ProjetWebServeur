***************************************************CONCEPT*****************************************************

You work for x days and then you are welcomed for 2x days? Isn't cool? 

#How does it work?

It's a webapp with to kind of customers:

The one who wanna travel for free (The worker)
And the one who needs services for free (The welcomer)

Both of thems need to create an acount on our website, and give us some information that we stock in a Data-

Then then can chose to search an announce or post it.

*********************************************** PROJECT DRIVING ***********************************************

This project is lead by three student of Paris Descartes computer sciences department :

Alexandre DESCAMP: Leader in back office dev.
Nicoloas THIBAULT: Leader in DataBase dev.
Yannis LE GUEN:    Leader in Front Office dev & Project Main Driver.

At this moment, we are still learning web technologies (PHP for Alex, FTP Servers for Nico & JS for Yannis).

But, before starting development we did some models (Merise & UML for our SQL DB, InDesign to create the lines
of the website.

In front dev we did :

1. A logo which leads us to a graphical charter
2. A simple navbar with Subscribing an login button
3. A caroussel with a SearchBox which is going to be but in front of the caroussel with css' zindex (I know it
is dirty)
4. Three containers which will upload the latest announce, the best works categories & the best destinations)
5. A form which allows users to create a new account
6. A form which permits users to connect themselves.

In back dev we did : 

1. The connection btwin the subscription form & the DB.
2. The connection btwin the logon form & the DB.

PS : Alex is learning Symfoni at the same time, that's why it can look not much.

In db dev we did :

1. The implementation of merise models in an SQL database by using PhpMyAdmin interface
2. Download every city in the world
3. Create some users for testing

Know we need to create a search page, reservation actions & work on the security of our db!
